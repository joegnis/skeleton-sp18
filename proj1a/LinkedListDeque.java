/**
 * Double ended queue
 *
 * Space complexity:
 * The amount of memory used at any given time is proportional to the number of items. For example, if you add 10,000
 * items to the deque, and then remove 9,999 items, the resulting size should be more like a deque with 1 item
 * than 10,000. Does not maintain references to items that are no longer in the deque.
 *
 * Time complexity:
 * - {@link #addFirst(T)}, {@link #addLast(T)}, {@link #removeFirst()}, and {@link #removeLast()} take constant time.
 * - {@link #size()} takes constant time
 * - {@link #get(int)} takes linear time
 *
 * Does not use Javaâ€™s built in LinkedList data structure (or any data structure from java.util.*)
